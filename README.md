Your solo project is going to require you to accomplish something you've never done before. There is some part about it (complicated SQL queries, an API you haven't worked with before, payments, image upload, task scheduling, sending email/text messages, etc) that is probably a little intimidating.

    Check out this list of Common Solo Project Technologies in React, for some ideas of what previous students have used to tackle some of these problems.

    Submit in the portal a brief description of what you plan to spike before you leave. (You dont have to have the repo made yet)

    Create a spike (very small example) that will serve as a "Proof of Concept" for this really hard part of your project.

    Note: DO NOT use the solo project starter repo! You want to keep this as simple as possible to focus on the new part.

    Submit the GitHub link to your repo in the portal.
